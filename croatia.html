                            Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a maritime border with Italy to the west
                             and southwest. Its capital and largest city, Zagreb, forms one of the country's primary subdivisions,
                              with twenty counties. The country spans 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), and has

                    <p>Dubrovnik (Croatian: [dǔbroːʋniːk] (listen)),[1] historically known
                         as Ragusa (Italian: [raˈɡuːza]; see notes on naming), is a city in southern Dalmatia,
                          Croatia, by the Adriatic Sea. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations 
                          in the Mediterranean, a seaport and the centre of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County.
                           Its total population is 41,562 (2021 census).[2] In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik
                            was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in recognition of its outstanding
                             medieval architecture and fortified old town.[3]

                        The history of the city probably dates back to the 7th century, when the town known as
                         Ragusa was founded by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia). It was under the protection 
                         of the Byzantine Empire and later under the sovereignty of the Republic of Venice. Between 
                         the 14th and 19th centuries, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state.

                    <p>Krk (pronounced [kr̩̂k]; Italian: Veglia; Istro Romanian: Krk; Vegliot Dalmatian: Vikla; archaic German: 
                        Vegl, Latin: Curicta; Greek: Κύρικον, translit. Kyrikon) is a Croatian island in the northern Adriatic Sea, 
                        located near Rijeka in the Bay of Kvarner and part of Primorje-Gorski Kotar county. Krk is tied with Cres
                         as the largest Adriatic island, depending on the methodology used to measure the coastline.[2] 
                        Krk is the most populous island in the Adriatic, with multiple towns and villages that contain a total of 19,383 (2011) inhabitants.
                        Archeological findings indicate that the island was inhabited continuously since Neolithic, 
                        although very few information the earliest people is known. In later periods, Greek and Latin 
                        sources refer to Κύριστα (Ancient Greek) or Curicta (Latin) as one of the Apsyrtidian or Electridian
                         islands held by the people known as Liburnians.

                        third-largest city in Croatia (after Zagreb and Split). It is located in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County 
                        on Kvarner Bay, an inlet of the Adriatic Sea and in 2021 had a population of 108,622 inhabitants.[1]
                         Historically, because of its strategic position and its excellent deep-water port, the city was fiercely contested,
                          especially between the Holy Roman Empire, Italy and Croatia, changing rulers and demographics many times over centuries. 
                          According to the 2011 census data, the majority of its citizens are Croats, along with small numbers of Serbs, Bosniaks and Italians.
