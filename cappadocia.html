                <h1><span>C</span>appadocia </h1>
                <p>Cappadocia (/kæpəˈdoʊʃəˌ -ˈdoʊkiə/; Turkish: Kapadokya) is a historical region in Central
                    Anatolia,
                    Turkey. It is largely in the provinces of Nevşehir, Kayseri, Aksaray, Kırşehir, Sivas and Niğde.
                    According to Herodotus,[1] in the time of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC),
                    the Cappadocians were reported as occupying a region from Mount Taurus
                    to the vicinity of the Euxine (Black Sea). Cappadocia, in this sense,
                    was bounded in the south by the chain of the Taurus Mountains that separate
                    it from Cilicia, to the east by the upper Euphrates, to the north by Pontus,
                    and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern Galatia.[2]
                    The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout history,
                    continues in use as an international tourism concept to define a region
                    of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by fairy chimneys and a unique
                    historical and cultural heritage.

                <p>Göreme (Turkish: [ɟœˈɾeme]; Ancient Greek: Κόραμα, romanized: Kòrama)
                    is a town (belde) in the Nevşehir District, Nevşehir Province in Central
                    Anatolia, Turkey.[2] Its population is 2,034 (2022).[1] It is well known for
                    its fairy chimneys (Turkish: peribacalar), eroded rock formations, many
                    of which were hollowed out in the Middle Ages to create houses, churches
                    and underground cities. Göreme was formerly known as Korama, Matiana, Macan and Avcilar.[3]
                    Göreme sits at the heart of a network of valleys filled with astonishing rock formations.
                    It also has the most painted churches in Cappadocia. When the nearby Göreme Valley
                    was designated to become the most important tourist centre for Cappadocia (Turkish: Kapadokya),
                    the village's name was changed to Göreme for practical reasons.

                <p>The Derinkuyu underground city (Cappadocian Greek: Μαλακοπή Malakopi;
                    Turkish: Derinkuyu Yeraltı Şehri) is an ancient multi-level underground
                    city of the Median Empire in the town of Derinkuyu in Nevşehir Province,
                    Turkey, extending to a depth of approximately 85 metres (280 ft).
                    It is large enough to have sheltered as many as 20,000 people together
                    with their livestock and food stores.
                    It is the largest excavated underground city
                    in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found throughout Cappadocia.
                    The underground city at Derinkuyu could be closed from the inside with large rolling
                    stone doors. Each floor could be closed off separately.[1]
                    The city could accommodate up to 20,000 people and had amenities found
                    in other underground complexes across Cappadocia.

                <p>Uçhisar is a town (belde) in the Nevşehir District, Nevşehir Province in Cappadocia,
                    Turkey.[2] Its population is 3,555 (2022).[1] It is 7 kilometres east of Nevşehir,
                    12 kilometres west of Ürgüp, and 10 kilometres south of Avanos.
                    Situated on the edge of Göreme National Park, Uçhisar consists of an old village huddled
                    around the base of a huge rock cone and a new one closer to the road that runs from Nevşehir
                    town to Göreme. Like most of Cappadocia, Uçhisar once made a living from agriculture but now depends
                    almost entirely on tourism, with many of its fine old stone houses turned into boutique hotels.
                    French incomers and Turks returning from France have played a large part in the move to convert the
                    houses into hotels.
                    Uçhisar means 'Outer Citadel' in Turkish and refers to the huge rock cone that is its central
                    feature.
