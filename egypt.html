                    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu
                        , who ruled under the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, 
                        over a period of about 27 years,[3] the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,
                         and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza
                          pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis".[4] 
                          It is situated at the northern end of the line of the three pyramids at Giza.
                          The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, 
                          a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of 5+1/2 palms (a slope of 51°50'40").

                  <p>The magical city of Aswan, formerly known as Swenett,
                     is located in the south of Egypt. The word Aswan is derived from the ancient 
                     Egyptian word “Soun”, which means souk or market. Aswan earned its name because
                      it was a strategic gateway to the South. In ancient times, it was the main provider
                       of granite used for obelisks and sculptures.
                    Aswan is known for its beautiful Nile Valley scenery,
                     significant archaeological sites and its peaceful aura.
                      Its weather is warm all year round, which makes it a perfect winter destination.
                    The city provides splendid views and attractions to sail through the Nile with a 
                    felucca (Egyptian sailboat). The river flows gently from Lake Nasser, through various islands, 
                    surrounded by black granite and greenery.
