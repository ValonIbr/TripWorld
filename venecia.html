                    <p>Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/ VEH-niss; Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] (listen); Venetian: 
                        Venesia or Venexia[citation needed] [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northeastern Italy
                         and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small
                          islands[3] that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions
                           of the city are linked by over 400 bridges.[3][4] The islands are in the shallow 
                           Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave
                            rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 
                            people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 
                            live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the 
                            mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan
                         Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.[5]

                    <p>The Ca' d'Oro or Palazzo Santa Sofia is a palace on the Grand Canal in Venice,
                         northern Italy. One of the older palaces in the city, its name means "golden house"
                          due to the gilt and polychrome external decorations which once adorned its walls. 
                          Since 1927, it has been used as a museum, as the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti.
                        It has long been regarded as the best surviving palazzo in Venetian Gothic
                         architecture, retaining all the most characteristic features, despite some losses.
                          On the facade, the loggia-like window group of closely spaced small columns,
                           with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above, uses the formula from the 
                           Doge's Palace that had become iconic. There are also the byzantine-inspired decoration 
                           along the roofline, and patterning in fancy coloured stone to the flat wall surfaces. The smaller windows
                         show a variety of forms with an ogee arch, capped with a relief ornament, and the edges
                          and zone boundaries are marked with ropework reliefs.

                    <p>Burano is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy, near Torcello
                         at the northern end of the lagoon, known for its lace work and brightly coloured homes.
                          The primary economy is tourism.[1
                        level
                        The island was probably settled by the Romans, and in the 6th century was occupied by people from Altino,
                         who named it for one of the gates of their former city. Two stories are attributed to how the city obtained its name.
                          One is that it was initially founded by the Buriana family, and another 
                        is that the first settlers of Burano came from the small island of Buranello, about 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the south.[citation needed]
                        Although the island soon became a thriving settlement, it was administered 
                        from Torcello and had none of the privileges of that island or of Murano. It rose in importance only in the 16th century,
                         when women on the island began making lace with needles, being introduced to such a trade via Venetian-ruled Cyprus.[8]

                    <p>This is one of the most suggestive walk you can have in Venice.
                         In front of you the Giudecca Canal, where cruise ships often navigate. Near here there is the Basilica of “Madonna della Salute”,
                        one of the most important church in Venice, and where you can find some Tiziano’s pictures.
                        A curious name that has its origin in the past, when the tree truncks from 
                        the closest mountains to Venice arrive with rafts (in Italian “zattere”) to the laguna, along the rivers.
The “Fondamenta” has a unique location. It overlooks the Giudecca and the treasures of this island, 
for exemple the church of “ The Santissimo Redentore”, designed by Andrea Palladio in 1557.
During your stay in Venice, an interesting and easy walk can start from Punta della Dogana where 
you can admire San Marco Basin from a special point of view
